STL streams that perform unicode encoding and decoding (e.g. UTF-8)

Contains STL input and output streams that can used for both pull and
push-style encoding and decoding.

The in-memory presentation of unicode strings is the same as used in 
Python, i.e. the type of a character is uint32_t (4 bytes). Uses iconv 
library (http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/) to perform the 
conversions. For example, the stream classes can be used to perform 
on-the-fly conversion when reading and writing to/from regular files.

Available classes:

    Unicode streams
	dec_istream - Decodes (reads bytes from an input iterator)
	enc_ostream - Encodes (writes the bytes with an output iterator)

    Byte streams
	dec_ostream - Push decode (writes the unicode with an output iterator)
	enc_istream - Pull encode (reads unicode from an input iterator)
